### 🧠 How It Works

1. The user enters a query and submits the form.
2. The app fetches search results from Wikipedia’s public API.
3. Each result includes a clickable title, the URL, and a snippet.
4. A loading spinner shows while results are being fetched.
5. A dark/light mode toggle switches the page's theme dynamically.

Would you like me to fix the bugs in the script (`searchWikipeida`, `results.pageid`, etc.) and give you the corrected version too?
